# Adds filtered HasMany and ManyToMany relationships to Jelly #

**This project is idle until Jelly reaches version 1.0, development will be resumed then.**

For an idea of how to use this, take a look at [the tests](https://github.com/leth/jelly-tests/tree/jelly-filtered).

In addition, some of what is implemented remains buggy and/or unfinished. To see what works, try running the unit tests.
